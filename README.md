# reticoloQR
Starting version of reticolo app.
App realized using Ionic Framework, AngularJS, Cordova and Leaflet.
Score of the project is to create an app that let you comunicate to a server the location of a
QRcode. If the QRcode is already present on the DB it should show your current position on a map
(in places where you can't use GPS, like inside buildings).
